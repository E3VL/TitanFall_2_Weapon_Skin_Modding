# Texture maps

## Beginnig with the basics

It should be common knowledge that the guns we use in game are models and these are made up of a lot of points called vertices and these are connected through edges which then come together to for individual faces.

This is a cube I made in Maya, note that for our usecase it is irrelevant wether u use Blender, Maya, 3dsmax or any other modeling tool.&#x20;

The Yellow Square is a selected Vertex.
