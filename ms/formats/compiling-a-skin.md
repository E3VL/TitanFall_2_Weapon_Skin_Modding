# Compiling a skin

**THE BELOW IS FOR PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO REVERT BACK TO DEFAULT SKINS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH FOR THIS JUST SKIP PAST**

**If you do not have the default textures, you are in luck** :https://github.com/BigSpice/TitanFall-2-Skin-Modding/tree/main/Textures/Compiled%20textures **Download whatever gun you want to revert back to normal and now just import it like normal**

##

In this tutorial I will show you how to pack a skin using zxcPandora's skin tool. **In this tutorial I am assuming you have already made the skin or are just replacing a current skin with default** | **WARNING PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE SKIN MAKER TOOL, NOT USER** https://github.com/zxcPandora/Titanfall2-SkinTool/releases Now that you have downloaded the skin tool maker, please run the tool and set the correct game path.&#x20;

Common Game locations: %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Titanfall2 | %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Origin Games\Titanfall2\\

Once you have set the game path, we can continue with the tutorial. Open the tool now and click on the tools tab towards the top, then on "skinpack maker". ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/904102903277584444/935876750611718185/CaptureaPNG.PNG)

What is shown in the screenshot is what should pop up, if so then we can continue.

Now, set a name for the skin you have made, then set the asset type, this NEEDS to match whatever model the skin is for. Next, set the save path.

Once you have done that, just drag the textures into the right locations, if you are unaware of what layer is what then reference this image :&#x20;

Once You have dragged the layers to the right locations, just click generate and we are almost done! Once the skin is done generating, just exit the skin maker tab and then click the three little dots to open a file explorer, select the skin zip and click "open". Once you click "import skin", you are done! You now have just successfully packed a skin and installed it!
