# Blender

## Info

Before we start, understand that this tutorial is making use of Blender as the main software.\
In this tutorial we will be using the .smd model format.\
You may still follow if you are using other software. (keep in mind as well, the process for some things wont be the EXACT same on other software)\
\[Substance tutorial will be released soonTM]\


## Getting our model

Firstly, we need to obtain the model for whatever it is you will be working on. To do this, simply head over to the main page of the [github](https://github.com/BigSpice/TitanFall-2-Skin-Modding), pick a format of your preference and find the model you need.

Once you have obtained the model you want, we can now obtain the textures for it. Head to the main page of the [github](https://github.com/BigSpice/TitanFall-2-Skin-Modding) and just simply navigate through the "textures" folder.

Now, you have the models and textures downloaded. What do I do with these you may ask. Now, we need to download the appropriate software to edit and make custom skins. For this, there is a plethora of tools you can use. [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [Substance Painter](https://youtu.be/0uKH4S7QD44), [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/free-trial), [Krita](https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/free-trial-download.html), etc.

## Software

For this tutorial we will be using Blender, if you want to use Substance Painter then please navigate to the substance tutorial. (substance tutorial may not be finished at this time)

If you are asking, are all of these software's free? Sadly only some are..BUT the ones that are free are: Blender, Krita, and Gimp.

There is a way to obtain Substance which is free and not illegal or pirating in any way. This method uses a service Adobe themselves offer. For more info on this follow this video: [https://youtu.be/0uKH4S7QD44](https://youtu.be/0uKH4S7QD44)

## Plugin install

Assuming you now have Blender installed and have ran it at least once, firstly delete the cube and camera that spawn upon loading Blender up the first time, then go to "file" in the top left then "defaults" and click "save startup file" This will get rid of useless junk every time you startup Blender

Next, we need to install a plugin to be able to import the model/s we installed. (This plugin allows you to import .smd .vta .dmx and .qc files)

Go to this link to install the plugin :[https://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/](https://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/) (Download the latest version)

Now that we have that installed, re-open Blender and go to "Preferences" found under the "edit" tab. Click the "add-ons" tab and go to "install"

Now locate your add-on and install as shown
